            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THe bleſſed Apoſtle, in his ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> cap. 1. ver. 13. writes thus: <hi>Hold faſt the form of good words which thou haſt heard of me, in faith and love.</hi> An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent admonition, and worthy to be preſſed upon all Chriſtians; but chiefly on thoſe who have wholly devoted themſelves to the ſtudy of Divinity. For as it concerns every Chriſtian to be skilled in the chief Catechiſtical Heads at leaſt, that by their help and guide they may with the greater profit hear and read Gods word; ſo it becomes all Students in Divinity, before all things to imprint in their memories the <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> of the Body of <hi>Theologie;</hi> that in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Places, in the Definitions and Diviſions of heavenly doctrine, they may be exact and perfect. Now in this kind divers eminent men, furniſhed with a far greater meaſure of Spiritual <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> then my ſelf, have afforded ſuch helps to young Students, that he who goes about to adde any thing to theſe, will ſeem to light a candle at noon tide, or to garniſh the firmament with more ſtars: Yet notwithſtanding, whereas it is conſiſtent with the conſcience and callings of all Gods ſervants, to advance what they can the publike benefit; <pb facs="tcp:116006:6"/> I being called to be chief Paſtor in this place, was enjoined by the Reverend Colledge of Divines to expound the Old Teſtament, which by Gods help and their command I ſo undertook, that beſides my Lectures on the Text, I propoſed to my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers a ſhort form of <hi>wholſome and good words,</hi> taken out of other mens lucubrations, and reduced into this brief <hi>Epitome.</hi> Now although I perceived that many did very well like my pains and purpoſe in this kind; yet I profeſſe, the divulging of this Piece was leaſt in my thoughts. Therefore, in that at laſt this Child, of which I have been in labour theſe ſeven years, is now born and brought out to light; I earneſtly intreat the friendly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to impute this not to any itching humour I have of writing, but to the often ſollicitations of my friends who have extorted it from me. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech God, that he will be pleaſed graciouſly to preſerve the remaining companies of Teachers and Schollers, and that for his mercies ſake, whereof we have daily freſh teſtimonies, as in many things, ſo in this, that we are not all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: And as for thoſe who are diſperſed, that he would graciouſly recollect and ſettle them, even for his onely begotten Sons ſake our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>

But <hi>Theologie</hi> properly ſo called, is either Original, or Derived. Original, is that knowledge whereby God knows himſelf, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally differs not from Gods eſſence. Derived, is a certain image or repreſentation of that Original, primarily in <pb n="2" facs="tcp:116006:8"/> Chriſt our Mediator, ſecondarily in Chriſts members. Now whereas part of Chriſts members is triumphant in heaven, another part militant here on earth; that Theologie of the triumphant part, is called the <hi>Theologie of the Bleſſed Saints;</hi> that of the militant, is ſtiled the <hi>Theologie of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers.</hi>

                     <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">For Theologie as it is comprehended within certain precepts, is different from the habit of Theologie, as the efficient cauſe from the effect. Now the queſtion is, if we conſider Divinity as the habit of the Intellect, what <hi>genus</hi> ſhall we aſſign for it out of the intellective habits? Surely there is none, which if it be taken ſolely and apart, is not of a narrower compaſſe then the thing defined. For that habit which apprehends the Principles, called <hi>Intelligentia;</hi> and that habit which demonſtrates the Concluſions out of the Principles, called <hi>Scientia;</hi> and that habit which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth out of the two former, called <hi>Sapientia,</hi> are habits meerly contemplative; but for <hi>Prudentia,</hi> it is an active habit directing the mind in its actions; and <hi>Art</hi> is an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive or operative habit with right reaſon.

But as it is a practical ſcience, it is the moſt noble of all practical ſciences, becauſe the end of it is be atitude, to winch the ends of all other ſciences are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                        </note> Divinity then conſiſts partly in contemplation, partly in action: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="3" facs="tcp:116006:8"/> Divinity may beare the name both of Sapience, and Prudence; Sapience, ſo far forth as it apprehends the principles, by means of the Intelligence being divinely il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate, and from thence demonſtrates the concluſions by means of Science; Of Prudence, ſo far forth as it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the mind of man in its actions.</p>

Thus ſaith the Lord. Jeſus ſaid. All Scripture is by divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration.</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. <hi>Holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But inwardly in the hearts of the faithful he perſwades the divinity of Scriptures, ſo far forth as he openeth the eyes, and illuminates the mind of him that reads the Scriptures with prayer and humility, that he makes him ſee the wonders of God, and cauſeth him to acknowledge the voice of Gods Spirit ſounding in the Word.</p>
                     <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">The Romaniſts urge the Churches authority alone, which they have in ſuch high eſteem, that they will have the whole authority of Scriptures to have its dependence from the Church; and for this onely cauſe they will have it to be Gods word, becauſe the Church is the witneſſe of it. But this is not to make the Church a witneſſe of the Scriptures divinity, but to make her ſelf capable of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But we will prove by theſe enſuing arguments, that the teſtimony of Gods Spirit alone is it, which firmly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us of the Scriptures divinity. 1. His teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Scriptures is moſt firm, by whoſe inſpiration the Scripture was written: For every one knows his own hand beſt, and is beſt acquainted with his own ſtile: But the Scripture was written by the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 20 21. <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c. 2. He that together with the Scripture is promiſed in a moſt neer conjunction to the faithful, his teſtimony of the Scripture is moſt firm: But the Holy Ghoſt is promiſed to the faithful in a moſt neer conjunction with the Scripture. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>My Spirit which is in thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart from thy mouth.</hi> 3. Without whoſe illumination the wonders of the Scripture are not ſeen, his teſtimony alone of the Scripture is moſt firm: But without the illumination of the Holy Ghoſt, no man ſees the wonders of the Scripture. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18. <hi>Open <pb n="6" facs="tcp:116006:10"/> my eyes, that I may ſee the wonders of thy law.</hi> Ergo, &amp;c. 4. Whoſe office it is to lead us into all truth, he it is that witneſſeth this truth, to wit, that the Scripture is Gods word: But it is the office of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>to lead us into all truth,</hi> Joh. 16.13. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> Now as for the Churches teſtimony, although it is to be received as from Gods miniſter, yet it is falſe that the Scriptures authority depends on it; For what can be more abſurd, then to make the words of the Maſter to receive their authority from the Servant; or the Fathers letters to receive credit from the Foot-poſt; or the Princes mandates from the Printer; or that the Rule ſhould have its dependence upon the thing ruled? We know that the oracles of God are committed to the Church, and that ſhe is the pillar and ground of truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. But as it is fooliſh to tell us, that the candle receives its light from the candleſtick that ſupports it, ſo it is riliculous to aſcribe the Scriptures authority to the Church. The Churches teſtimony may be preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with thoſe who as yet know not the Scriptures, and have not <hi>received that ſincere milk of the word, nor by it are grown up,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. But in thoſe who have taſted the ſweetneſſe of divine oracles, the teſtimony of Scriptures and of the Holy Ghoſt is moſt firm and effectual: For as he who taſteth hony himſelf, hath a more ſure knowledge of its ſweetneſſe, then he that believeth another ſpeaking and witneſſing of it; even ſo, he knoweth more aſſuredly the Scriptures to be Gods word, who hath taſted its ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then he who gives credit to the Church witneſſing this ſweetneſſe. The <hi>Samaritans</hi> at firſt believed the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man when ſhe ſpake of Chriſt; but after they heard Chriſt himſelf, they ſay to the woman, <hi>Now we believe, not becauſe of thy ſaying, for we have heard him our ſelves, and know that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the world,</hi> Joh. 4.42. Even ſo he that having begged the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Gods Spirit, reads the Scriptures again and again, at length ſaith, Now I believe no longer for the Churches teſtimony, that the Scriptures are divine; but becauſe I <pb n="7" facs="tcp:116006:10"/> have read them my ſelf, and in reading have ſtamped this Syllogiſm in my minde.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Concerning the Works of GOD, and the Decrees of GOD in generall.</head>
                  <p>THus God hath been conſidered in himſelf; Now he is to be conſidered in his works: which works are either Eſſential, or Perſonal. Thoſe are eſſential, which are common to the whole Trinity; but the perſonal, are thoſe which are proper to each perſon. Both theſe, as well eſſential as perſonal, are either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, or external objects. The internal are they, which have no reference to any object without God; as Underſtanding, by which God underſtands himſelf; the Generation of the Sonne, the Production of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Gods external work is that, which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſome object without the Trinity: ſuch are Predeſtination, Creation, and the like, which have relation to the Creatures as objects without God.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>So the incarnation of Chriſt, in reſpect of inchoation or initiation, is the eſſential work of the whole Trinity; but in reſpect of bounds or termination, it is the perſonal work of the Sonne alone: for though the Father and Holy Ghoſt are the cauſe of Chriſts incarnation, yet the Sonne only was incarnate. Even ſo, although Creation, Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, <pb n="27" facs="tcp:116006:20"/> Sanctification are eſſential works of the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet in another reſpect they are called perſonal: For the Father is called Creator, becauſe he is the Fountain both of the Trinity, and of operation; for the Sonne and Holy Ghoſt work from the Father. The <hi>Sonne</hi> is called <hi>Redeemer,</hi> becauſe having mans nature, he performed the work of redemption: But the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is called the <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> becauſe he is ſent from Chriſt as a Sanctifier and Comforter.</p>

The perſonal union of body and ſoul, in theſe words, <hi>And he was made a living ſoul,</hi> metonymically, that is a living ſenſitive crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But that the ſouls now are immediately created by God, and infuſed into the body, is proved by theſe ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Reaſons. 1. Becauſe otherways our ſouls ſhould have another original then <hi>Adams</hi> had; for ours muſt proceed of ſome pre-exiſtent matter, whereas <hi>Adams</hi> proceeded of none. Neither will that objection hold, concerning the different way or reaſon of generation, and creation; for nothing is generated of matter, but what in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was created of matter. 2. Becauſe the ſoul of Chriſt was not formed of ſeed by traduction, for he was conceived not by the help of man, but by the operation of the holy Ghoſt, of the bleſſed Virgins blood. 3. Becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, when it ſpeaks of the original of our ſouls, it ſpeaks as of a work of Creation, not of nature. <hi>Job</hi> 33.4. <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <pb n="44" facs="tcp:116006:29"/> of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath given me life.</hi> Zach. 12.1. <hi>The Lord ſtretcheth out the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the ſpirit of man within him;</hi> where it is plain that this is reckoned among the works of Creation. 4. Such is mans generation, as his diſſolution is; but mans diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that his body returns to duſt, and his Spirit to God that gave it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.9. Whereas then in mans diſſolution, the Spirit returns immediatly to God, doubtleſs it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly formed by him. 5. Becauſe the Scripture doth plainly diſtinguiſh between the parts of bodies and Spirits. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. 6. Becauſe the ſoul is indiviſible into parts, therefore cannot be produced but of nothing. 7. Becauſe if it were generated by traduction, either it muſt be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of a ſoul, or of a body, or of a ſoul and body toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but it is not generated of a ſoul,

Their other knowledge is by grace, and that is either ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, or practical; the former is not totally loſt, but much diminiſhed; for of Gods ſecrets they know very little. But the practick knowledge, which is joyned with the love of God, and deteſtation of evil, is totally loſt in them: for ſuch evil cannot conſiſt with obſtinate malice; yet as they naturally know God, ſo they naturally love him as an Entity, but not morally, as he is the fountain of all happineſs, of which they know themſelves to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally deprived.</p>

                  <p>The manner of the Levitical ſervice conſiſted partly in the things that were offered to God, partly in holy times.</p>
                  <p>The things that were offered to God, were ſacrifices both Expiatory, or of Propitiation; &amp; Euchariſtical, or of Thankſgiving.</p>
                  <p>The Expiatory ſacrifice, or Peace-offering was, when the faithful witneſſed by the killing and offering of living creatures, that they, in themſelves were guilty of death, and that they placed their confidence in the blood of Chriſt as of that immaculate Lamb, who was to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered afterward for the ſins of the world.</p>
                  <p>The ſacrifice of Thankſgiving was offered <pb n="84" facs="tcp:116006:49"/> either for all ſins, or for ſome certain ſins.</p>
                  <p>The ſacrifice that was offered for all ſinnes, was called a <hi>Holocauſt</hi> or burnt-offering; for it was performed by burning the whole ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
                  <p>The ſacrifice for certain ſins, called the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of <hi>Redemption,</hi> was either for the ſinne it ſelf, or for the guilt thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Sinne-offering was, when a ſinne was expiated, which had been committed out of error or ignorance. <hi>See</hi> Levit. 4.2, 3.</p>
                  <p>The ſacrifice for the guilt, called the Treſpas-offering, was, when a ſin was expiated which had been done wittingly, yet out of infirmity. Lev. 5. &amp; 7.</p>
                  <p>The Euchariſtical ſacrifice, or Offering of Thankſgiving, was to teſtifie the gratitude of the offerer. Theſe were performed by offering of gifts onely, or by offering of living creatures alſo.</p>
                  <p>The ſacrifice of gifts, called <hi>Libatio,</hi> or Meat-offering, was that, in which meat, drink, oyle, ſalt, frankincenſe, &amp;c. were offered.</p>
                  <p>The ſacrifice of Living-creatures, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed either by burning the fat of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or by killing and eating of the beaſts alſo: That was called, the Sacrifice of Pacification; This, the Sacrifice of Praiſe.</p>
                  <p>The holy times, were either of dayes, or of yeares.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:116006:49"/>
                  <p>Of dayes were, 1. The morning of each day, and the two evenings, in which the daily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was offered. 2. The ſeventh or Sabbath-day, which was a type of that ſanctification and reſt which was to be obtained by Chriſt. 3. The Calends or New-moons, or firſt day of the moneth.</p>
                  <p>The times of the yeares, were either anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, or every yeare, or elſe after the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of divers years.</p>
                  <p>The anniverſary Solemnities were either greater or leſſer.</p>
                  <p>The greater were, the Feaſts of Eaſter, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt, and of Tabernacles.</p>
                  <p>The feaſt of Eaſter was celebrated the fiftieth day of the firſt moneth, as a remembrance of the peoples delivery from Egypt, and as a type of their future delivery by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The feaſt of Pentecoſt was kept the fifty day after Eaſter, as a memorial of the Law given upon mount Sinai, and as a type of that new Law which was to be written in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, who was to be ſent afterward in a viſible form.

                  <p>The feaſt of Tabernacles was ſolemnized the fifteenth day of the ſeventh moneth, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of that gracious preſervation of the Iſraelites in the deſart in tents, and as a type <pb n="86" facs="tcp:116006:50"/> of Chriſts incarnation: Thanks alſo were given to God, at this feaſt, for the fruits and harveſt; whence it was called the Feaſt of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The leſſer ſolemnities were, The feaſt of Trumpets celebrated the firſt day of the ſeventh moneth, in which the civil yeare had its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the feaſt alſo of Expiation, which fell out upon the tenth day of the ſame moneth: That did repreſent the ſounding of the Goſpel; this, of our atonement to be made by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Solemnities that were kept after divers years, were the Sabbathical year, and the year of Jubile.</p>
                  <p>The Sabbathical year, or year of weeks, was every ſeventh year, in which there was a ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from tilling the ground, and from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of debts.</p>
                  <p>The yeare of Jubile was every fiftieth yeare, in which all poſſeſſions returned to their own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the Hebrew ſervants were ſet free; A type of our freedome from Sin and Satan by Chriſt.</p>

                                 <label>A. R.</label> It is ſaid here, that <hi>Ignorance is attributed to Chriſt;</hi> This cannot be meant properly; for it was not fit there ſhould be ignorance in him, who came to cure our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: And if ignorance be the want of that knowledge which ought to be in us, 't muſt needs be ſin in whomſoever it is. There is a difference between theſe two phraſes: <hi>Not to know,</hi> and <hi>to be ignorant:</hi> for ignorance is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of knowledge, which is a habit; and that was not in him, in whom were hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge. And ſo <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh. 21. and all the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. confeſſe that Chriſt knew all things. But not to know, ſignifieth the ſuſpenſion of the act of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge only, which can be no privation in him that hath the habit. To wink, is not to be blind; for he that winks hath the habit of ſight, which a blind man wants. Again, <hi>to know</hi> in Scripture is ſometime to make known; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. <hi>Now I know that thou feareſt me;</hi> that is, I have made it known. So, <hi>not to know,</hi> is <hi>not to make known,</hi> by the rule of contraries. So, Chriſt knew not the laſt day; that is, he made it not known, or he did not know that day to reveal it. So when Chriſt is ſaid to increaſe in knowledge, is not meant that he was ignorant, but that he attained to the knowledge which he had before, after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then he did before, that is, experimentally now, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually before.</p>

                        <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">This is denied by the Samoſatenians and Pontificians, who teach that Chriſt was Mediator onely according to his humanity. But this rule is grounded upon a moſt firm reaſon: for if the works of the Mediator be the perfect operations of God and man, in which is required not only the action of man, but of God alſo; then doubtleſs this office is attributed to Chriſt, even according to his Divinity: but the former is true, and therefore the latter. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption may be proved by examples; without the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Deity, neither can he declare the hid wiſdom of God, nor illuminate our mindes: without the power of the Deity, neither could his ſatisfaction obtain the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of merit with God, nor could his Interceſſion be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual: without the Deity, neither could he have ſuſtained that heavy burthen of Gods wrath, nor had he been able to ſubdue or aboliſh death and Satan: without the vertue of the Deity, neither could he have ſaved his Church, nor have ſubdued his enemies. Neither is it any hindrance to this Truth, that there is one Mediator of God and man, <hi>the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. for there the word <hi>man,</hi> is not the word of the nature, but of the perſon: and when he is ſaid to be the Mediator of God and man, it is preſuppoſed that the Mediation is hypoſtatical, as Chriſt is God and man. In the interim there are many teſtimonies which prove the operation of the Deitie, <hi>Act.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of the Humiliation of Chriſt.</head>
                  <p>SO much of the Perſon and Office of the Mediator Chriſt: the State thereof, is the condition in which Chriſt as God-man did execute his office of Mediatorſhip; and this is either of his Humiliation, or of his Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The State of Humiliation is, in which he took the form of a Servant, being in the form of God, and gave obedience to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for us; he died, and was buried, and went down to Hell: And in this ſtate he ſo perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Prophetical, Sacerdotal, and Regal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that in a manner he ſtript himſelf of the form and glory of the Divinity.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">He did not caſt off the Divinity, but had it in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med form of a ſervant: And although the Deity of Chriſt did manifeſt it ſelf in the ſtate of his Humiliation, chiefly by miracles; yet this was little in compariſon of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manifeſtation of him in his Exaltation.</p>
                  <p>In the ſtate of Humiliation he performed his Prophetical office, not only mediately, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> his Herauld before, and by the Apoſtles whom he called; but alſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to his loſt ſheep, eſpecially of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by preaching to them the heavenly Truth, with <pb n="109" facs="tcp:116006:61"/> great conſtancy, patience, and efficacy, both of his doctrine and miracles.</p>
                  <p>But his Sacerdotal office he adminiſtred in this ſtate, making a moſt full ſatisfaction, and an humble interceſſion for us.</p>
                  <p>The ſatisfaction of Chriſt is that, whereby he being ſubject to the Law for us, did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the curſe due to our ſins, and performed moſt perfectly obedience to the Law which was required of us, and ſo hath freed us from the curſe, and hath reſtored us to life.</p>
                  <p>This conſiſteth in ſuffering the pains, and in perfect juſtice; in that is ſeen chiefly his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, in this his active obedience.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">I do purpoſely adde this reſtriction, that we may not think his active and paſſive obedience ſo to differ, as if the ſuffering of the puniſhment conſiſted onely in his paſſive obedience, and his perfect juſtice onely in his active; for they differ not in time, ſeeing both of them continued from the firſt moment of his incarnation till his death. Nor do they differ in ſubject, becauſe the ſame obedience in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reſpect is both active and paſſive; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſts obedience is an active paſſion, and a paſſive action: for as paſſion is a receiving of the puniſhment, it is called paſſive obedience; but as it is a teſtimony of his great love, it may be called active. Neither is the diviſion of obedience into active and paſſive, a diviſion into parts, but onely a diſtinction taken from the end; to wit, the twofold ſatisfaction, for puniſhment, and for life eternal: The curſe upon the tranſgreſſors of the Law requires the former, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. The promiſe of life under the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perfect obedience and righteouſneſs requires the latter, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.15. Therefore we are ſaid Analogically by <pb n="110" facs="tcp:116006:62"/> that one and moſt perfect ſatisfaction of Chriſt, both to be freed from the puniſhment, becauſe he ſuffered the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for us, and to be inveſted in the right of life eternal, becauſe he fulfilled the Law for us.</p>
                  <p>The ſuffering of puniſhment is, whereby he undertook upon himſelf the puniſhment due to us, and offered himſelf of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord a holy Sacrifice to God for us. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth both in the ſufferings which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his great and laſt Paſſion, but eſpecially in this laſt agonie.</p>

                                 <hi>* In Chriſts death, the Perſonal Union was not diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi> This is true; and the reaſon is, becauſe the gifts of God are without repentance: now the Hypoſtatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is the greateſt of his gifts, which could not be loſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin; and ſin could not be in him, who came to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: its true, Chriſt ſeems to grant a dereliction, when he ſaith, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> But theſe words do not ſhew any dereliction or diſſolution of the perſonal union in death, for Chriſt spake them whilſt he was alive: they only ſhew, that Chriſt was left to tread the wine-preſſe alone; and yet he was not alone, for the Father is with me, <hi>ſaith he.</hi> Chriſt was alone and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken in reſpect of deliverance, but not alone nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken in respect of the Divine preſence and aſſiſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he could not have performed that great work of our redemption. In that the Father left him in the hands of his enemies, and did not deliver him, he might be ſaid to forſake him. But it may be objected, that Chriſts ſoule was the medium of the union between the Divinity and Chriſts body: This medium being gone, how could the extremes cohere? I anſwer, in this union the ſoul was the medium of congruity, not of neceſſity; for the Divinity was united to Chriſts body in the Virgins womb, before the ſoul was infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or elſe he could not have bin conceived by the Holy Ghoſt. So might the Divinity be united ſtill to the body, after the ſoul was ſeparated. The ſoul indeed being aspirit, was a fit medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um to unite the Deity to the body, but not abſolutely neceſſary.</p>

Both opinions are repugnant to the ſtory of the Goſpel: for whereas Chriſt otherwayes in reſpect of his Deity is every where, his ſoule being recommended into the hands of his Father by himſelf whilſt he hung on the Croſſe, and his body being laid up in the grave, it muſt needs be falſe that Chriſt did locally go down to hell. Beſides, whereas God doth profeſſe that he is their God after death, <hi>Exo.</hi> 3.6 there can be nothing more abſurd, then that the ſoules of the Fathers ſhould be detained in that <hi>limbus</hi> or priſon. <hi>Peter</hi> witneſſeth, 1 <hi>ep.</hi> 3.19. that Chriſt preached to the Spirits of old that were diſobedient: but this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of that preaching which was before the flood by <hi>Noah,</hi> being furniſhed or inſtructed for this purpoſe by the Spirit of Chriſt. Neither is there any ground for that fiction of Chriſts triumph in hell; both becauſe he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed not before his reſurrection, as alſo becauſe heaven was the fit place of his triumph, not hell. Again, whereas the word <hi>Shc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pſ. 49.15. <hi>Like ſheep they <pb n="115" facs="tcp:116006:64"/> lie in hell, death gnaweth upon them.</hi> Iſa. 14.11, &amp;c. The firſt expoſition hath no place in the fourth Article of the Creed; for it is unlikely that in ſo brief an Epitome of Faith there ſhould be any tautologie, or that a plain ſpeech ſhould be declared by a darker. In the ſecond, the inconvenience of a diſordered narration ſeems to reſiſt, to wit, that Chriſts extreme ſadneſſe and anguiſh of mind are rehearſed to be after his death. But <hi>Calvin</hi> makes the matter plain, ſhewing that the order of things, and not of time is obſerved: ſo that there are two members of that Article; the former is of the tortures of the body, the latter of the internal torments of the mind. They who maintain the third expoſition, do chiefly urge the order of paſſages; both becauſe the detention of Chriſt in the grave is the laſt degree of humiliation, as alſo becauſe by this means the degrees of his joyful exaltation do anſwer the ſufferings of Chriſt; to wit, his Reſurrection anſwers his Death; the Sepulture, his aſcenſion to heaven; and his deſcending to hell, the ſitting at his Fathers right hand. Now as this opinion is not diſliked, ſo the former is not raſhly to be rejected; nor ſhould we diſpute contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in this matter, ſeeing this clauſe of Chriſts deſcent to hell was not alwayes added to the fourth Article, as the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed and divers others do witneſſe. So that this may remain firm, that neither his ſpiritual agonies in his ſoule, nor his three dayes detention in the grave, ought to be ſeparated from his ſufferings.</p>

But they who acknowledge his paſſive obedience only ſatisfactory and meritorious, ſay that his active obedience makes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our Redemption and Salvation but only as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary help, or the cauſe without which Salvation could not be obtained: for ſay they, this active obedience is required for two cauſes: Firſt, by the right of Creation; Secondly, that his Sacrifice might be acceptable to God, and that he might be a holy High-Prieſt. But the firſt branch of this opinion is falſe; for Chriſt is not in this to be compared with other men: for as the Son of God was made man and a creature for us, not for himſelf, ſo he was made

Two things here are objected. 1. If Chriſts active obedience is the cauſe of eternal Life, then he ſuffered in vain. 2. If Chriſt obeyed for us, then we need not yield obedience. But in the firſt Argument there is no conſequence; for there is one end, which is common to both parts of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to wit, our ſalvation; another, proper to each one: for the end of his ſuffering, was our delivery from evil; but the end of Juſtice is the procuring of right to eternal life. The latter Argument againſt the merit of active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is ſuch a one as <hi>Socinus</hi> frames againſt the merit of paſſive obedience: If, quoth he, Chriſt died in our ſtead, then we need not die. But there is no conſequence in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: there is one death of Chriſt, another of the godly: that was joyned with a curſe, this with a bleſſing; Chriſt did undergo that as the wages of our ſins, but we undergo this as a paſſage from this life to a heavenly: ſo there is one obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt, another of man; that was perfect Juſtice which he performed in our ſtead, to purchaſe life for us; but this is imperfect, and is performed to ſhew our grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for our redemption.</p>

But we muſt know wherein the clarity of a Sacrament conſiſteth chiefly, to wit, not in external ſignes only, but in the Sacramental word. Now are not theſe words very clear: <hi>This is my body which is given for you; This is my blood which is ſhed for you?</hi> There is nothing ſo plain concerning Chriſts death, in the Paſſeover. Beſides, it is falſe that the killing of a Lamb was a cleerer ſigne; becauſe many more and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure ſigns were added to the killing of the Lamb; as alſo becauſe the breaking of bread, the pouring out of wine, and the receiving of both, do moſt clearly repreſent the breaking of Chriſts body, the ſhedding of his blood, and the participation of both.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">Three things are required to a Sacrament. 1. That it be inſtituted by God under the Covenant of grace. 2. That it may have an external Symbol ordained by God. 3. That the Promiſe of grace may be annexed to it. Now theſe three belong only to Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, and not to any of the reſt. Confirmation is a Popiſh ceremony, in which the Biſhop or his Suffragan having asked certain queſtions of the party baptized, concerning the Heads of Religion, beſmears him with a little ointment, putting a <pb n="150" facs="tcp:116006:82"/> linnen-cloth on him, not to be removed by the witneſſes before the third day; and he cuffs him, the better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the matter, and that he may be ſufficiently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the Holy Ghoſt againſt Satans tentations. But where in Scripture do we read of the inſtitution of this Sacrament, and of its ceremonies? where is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? We may more truly call this the Popes excrement, then a Sacrament; and that mark which the Beaſt puts upon the forehead of his worſhippers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3, 16. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore impiouſly do they preferre this Sacrament to Baptiſm; for they teach plainly, that Baptiſm is perfected by it, an that in this there is a greater meaſure of ſpiritual gifts then in Baptiſm: and whereas any Prieſt or Paſtor may admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Baptiſm, yea any Lay-man, or woman; Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt only be performed by the Biſhop or his Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. Penance is a Sacrament with them, in which the ſinner having given trial of his repentance, is abſolved by the Prieſt. We indeed acknowledge, that repentance is enjoyned to ſinners, and that a power of abſolving is given to Miniſters; though they feign a far other penance and abſolution, as ſhall appear hereafter: But in the mean while, there is no outward ſymbol inſtituted by God which hath a promiſe; neither can theſe words, <hi>[I abſolve thee]</hi> be in ſtead of a ſymbol, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would have it. Extreme Unction is a Sacrament amongſt them, in which the Prieſt having rehearſed ſome Letanies, anointeth the party that is dying, with hallowed oile of the Olive, in thoſe parts of the body where the ſeats of the five Senſes are; and this he doth after the parties confeſſion and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, to the end he may recover his health, if it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for him, and that the remainder of his ſinnes, after he hath received the other Sacraments, may be wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Chriſt indeed promiſed his Diſciples, that the ſick on whom they were to lay their hands, ſhould recover, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.18. <hi>James</hi> alſo commanded that the ſick ſhould be anointed, after impoſing of hands and prayer by the Elders: which ceremonies were not Sacraments, but vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary <pb n="151" facs="tcp:116006:82"/> rites joyned with miracles, which together with the gifts of miracles are expired. Therefore between Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction, and this, there is no ſimilitude: For, that I may ſay nothing of that magical exorciſme with which the oile is hallowed, it is certain, that in the Apoſtles time, not only dying people (as now in Popery) but any alſo that were ſick, were anointed. Ordination is a Sacrament among them, in which the Biſhop alone or his Suffragan layeth his hands upon the Miniſter, and delivereth to him with ſolemn words a Book, a Platter, a Paſtoral ſtaffe, &amp;c. uſing alſo the ceremonies of Unction and Shaving, and imprints on him an indelible character, to conferre Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace, whereby he might rightly uſe the power of the Keyes. Now although Miniſters may be ordained by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands and prayers, after the example of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, yet this Impoſition is a thing indifferent; but for the Popiſh ceremonies, they are partly Jewiſh, as anointing, partly Heatheniſh, as ſhaving, expreſly forbid <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.27. Marriage is no Sacrament of the Covenant of grace, both becauſe it was inſtituted before the fall, as alſo becauſe it is common to all that are within, &amp; without the Covenant: yet we deny not but that Marriage is a repreſentation of that ſpiritual wedlock between Chriſt and his Church; but if for this it were a Sacrament, then there ſhould be ſo many Sacraments, as there be Parables and Allegories. Hence divers Schoolmen have denied this to be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And in what eſteem it is among the Papiſts, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this, that they make an irreconcileable war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Marriage and Ordination, and forbid Marriage in their Clergy, as if it were an unclean thing.</p>

His firſt Note is the name <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> But the impoſing of names is a matter rather of fact then of right; therefore, an argument taken from the name is of no force, without the thing anſwer to the name, Rev. 3.1. <hi>Thou art ſaid to live, but thou art dead.</hi> 2. Antiquity: but this belongs not to the Church alone, nor alwayes. Not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, <pb n="168" facs="tcp:116006:91"/> becauſe the World, the Heaven, the Elements, have antiquity, yet are not the Church; Not alwayes, becauſe the Church hath not been alwayes ancient, there was a time when ſhe was new: true Antiquity is the firſt principle of things, which as it is firſt, ſo it is moſt true; therefore, in general, the Churches antiquity is to be reckoned from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; in particular, the Apoſtolical Church, from the preaching of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as it is at this day, aroſe long after the Apoſtles times. 3. A conſtant duration without interruption. This indeed is the property of the viſible Catholike Church, but depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on Gods promiſes, it doth more appear to Faith then to ſenſe; and as that is not true antiquity which depends not from the firſt principle, ſo there can be no duration which hath not its original from the ſame. 4. Amplitude and multitude of Believers: this belongs not alwayes to the Church, as we may ſee in that Church that was in the time of our firſt Parents, <hi>Noah, Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. Yea this note is not natural to the Church; for there is ſtill the greater number amongſt the wicked, Mat. 7.13. <hi>Enter in at the narrow gate.</hi> &amp; Luke 12.32. <hi>Feare not little flock.</hi> 5. The ſucceſſion of Biſhops: But this alſo neither is the Churches Note alone, nor alwayes. Not alwayes; for as it was not in the beginning of the Church, ſo it will ceaſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end: not alone; for in the falſe Church there is found a ſucceſſion of Biſhops; whence we muſt look rather on the ſucceſſion of Doctrine then of perſons; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are to be judged by their Doctrine, not this by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; <hi>They have not Peters inheritance, who have not Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Faith,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> 6. An agreement in Doctrine with the ancient Church: This indeed is a true Note, but it is the ſame with ours, to wit, the purity of the Word and Sacraments, as it was in the time of the Apoſtolical Church, from which the <hi>Roman</hi> hath fallen. 7. The union of the members with their head the Pope, and among themſelves. The firſt limb of this Note belongs to the falſe and Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, not to the Apoſtolical Church: that Church is ſhe <pb n="169" facs="tcp:116006:91"/> that worſhips the Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.12. The latter cannot be a tributed to the Church alone; <hi>for there is union alſo among Divels,</hi> Matt. 12.8. The 8. is holineſſe of Doctrine, which is the ſame with the ſixth. 9. The ninth is efficacie of Doctrine; this alſo anſwers the ſixth, and our Notes too; but it agrees no wayes to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. 10. Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life in the firſt authors and planters of Religion. Now this Holineſſe is either inward or outward; if inward, 'tis not a mark of the viſible Church. <hi>He is a true Jew that is ſo in ſecret,</hi> Rom. 2.29. <hi>God knoweth who are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. if outward, it is falſe; for Satan can transform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of light, 2 Cor. 11.14. Therefore the Church is to be judged by her doctrine, not by the life of her Doctors, Mat. 23.2. <hi>Whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do, but do you not after their works.</hi> 11. The glory of Miracles. 12. The light of Propheſie. But the gifts of Miracles and Propheſie were extraordinary, given to confirm the Goſpel, which are now vaniſhed ſince the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hath been propagated; wherefore the Apoſtles make no promiſes of other miracles and propheſie, but they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make this bragging of Miracles and propheſie a Note of the Antichriſtian Church, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9 <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.13. And Chriſt himſelf ſaith, that <hi>He will not know ſuch,</hi> Mat. 7.22.13. The thirteenth Note, is the confeſſion of adverſaries, as Hereticks, Jewes, &amp;c. But the authority of ſuch teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies is as great as the adverſaries themſelves are, by whoſe acceſſion nothing is added, and by the want nothing dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. 14. The fourteenth, is the unhappy end of thoſe who have oppoſed the Church. 15. The fifteenth, is the happineſſe of them who have defended her: But this Note is ſo uncertain, that it deſerveth not the name of a Note; <hi>for of ſuch, man knoweth not either love or hatred,</hi> Eccl. 9.3. Yea it is rather a Note of the falſe Church; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that for the moſt part the Churches condition in this life is wretched and ſad, Joh. 16.20. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, yee ſhall weep and lament, but the world ſhall rejoyce.</hi>

                  <p>THus in two Chapters we have conſidered the Church in her ſelf: Now of the Falſe Church, which is oppoſite to her, and her enemy.</p>
                  <p>The Churches enemies are either open, or ſecret.</p>

                  <p>Her open foes are Heathens, Jewes, and Mahumetans. The Heathens are they, who feign, paint, and worſhip falſe and fictitious Gods.</p>
                  <p>The Jews deny the Trinity, and the coming of the Meſſiah, and interpret carnally what is ſpoken of Chriſts kingdom in the Prophets ſpiritually.</p>
                  <p>The Mahumetans preferre their <hi>Mahumet</hi> to Chriſt, and their <hi>Alcoran</hi> to the Scriptures; which <hi>Alcoran</hi> that Impoſtor compiled by the help of a Neſtorian Monk and an Arrian, out of the ſink of Gentiliſme, Judaiſme, Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, Arrianiſme, and other hereſies.</p>
                  <p>The hid or counterfeit enemies, are either falſe Chriſts or Antichriſts. Falſe Chriſts are they, who brag themſelves to be Chriſt.</p>

                        <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">The Minor is proved by an induction or application of each member. 1. The firſt member is out of queſtion; <pb n="188" facs="tcp:116006:101"/> for every one knows that the Popes ſucceed each other. The ſecond member is manifeſt both by its effects, as alſo by their example who have attained that Seat by wicked arts and wayes, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Benedict</hi> the ninth, of whom ſee <hi>Platina</hi> and other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Writers. 3. By profeſſion, the Pope will not deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Chriſtian. 4. That he is Chriſts enemy, and that he hath made horns to himſelf, like thoſe of the Lamb, is apparent; becauſe he claims to himſelf Chriſts Prophetical, Sacerdotal, and Regal offices, together with the titles of High-Prieſt, Prince of Paſtors, Head and Husband of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> while he caſts by Chriſts word, as needleſs and obſcure, like a noſe of wax, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, yea, preferring his traditions to it: He overthrows Chriſts Prophetical office, whilſt he urgeth the merits and interceſsion of <hi>Mary</hi> and of the Saints: He deſtroys Chriſts Prieſthood, and his Kingly office, whilſt he takes upon him to do what he pleaſeth in the Church. But if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Chriſts life with the Popes, the humility of the one with the pride of the other, the doctrine of the one with the doctrine of the other, concerning Free-will, Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Sacraments, and ſuch like articles, it will appear that fire and water are not more contrary. 5. That he ſits in the temple of God, that is, in the Church, which is his temple, as is ſaid, is manifeſt. Now the Roman Church, as it is Popiſh, is not called the temple of God. But 1. As in <hi>Johns</hi> time it was the true Church of Chriſt; and ſo the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of old, was called the temple of God, though it had been converted to a den of theeves, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. 2. As God hath there yet thoſe that belong to election: The Pope is born in the Church, he ſits in her, not as her true and naturall Son, but as a Monſter, a bunch or ſwelling, or as a canker cleaving faſt to the body: Furthermore, that he ſits there as God, the titles which his Flatterers give him, make it plain: they deny him to be a man; therefore they call him <hi>Admirable,</hi> which is Chriſts title, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 9.6. &amp;c. <hi>(Gloſſ. de Elect. c. fund.)</hi> 
                           <pb n="189" facs="tcp:116006:101"/> Alſo their <hi>Lord God, de conceſſ. praeb. c. propoſuiſti.</hi> In the Councel of <hi>Lateran,</hi> the acclamation which they gave to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth was, <hi>To thee is given all power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth.</hi> But he extols himſelf above God, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in preferring himſelf before Magiſtrates, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led gods, eſpecially before the Emperour whom he calls the Moon, and himſelf the Sun, but alſo by preferring his Decrees to Gods Word, and conſequently himſelf to God. 6. He poſſeſſeth that city, which hath ſeven hils, and had ſeven kings. That <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſeven hills all the world knows; but the ſeven Kings, metonymically, are the ſeven forms of Government which were in <hi>Rome</hi> before Popery: for there were, 1. Kings, 2. Conſuls, 3. Dictators, 4. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the People, 5. the Decemviri, 6. Tribunes of the Souldiers, 7. Emperors. Of whom the Angel ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.10. <hi>Five are now fallen,</hi> to wit, the Kingdom, the Dictatorſhip, the Tribuneſhip of the People, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemvirat, &amp; Tribune-ſhip of the Souldiers. <hi>One,</hi> ſaith he, is, to wit, the Emperour with the Conſuls, which remained under the Empire: therefore he ſaith, five, not ſix, are fallen: and another was not yet come, <hi>ibid. v.</hi> 10. to wit, the Pope; and he is one of the ſeven; and is the eighth: <hi>ibid. v.</hi> 11. the eighth, in reſpect of the ſeven that went before; of the ſeven, becauſe the power, tyranny, idolatry, &amp;c. of all the ſeven governments or kingdomes have met together in Popery as it were in a ſink. <hi>He was,</hi> ſaith the Angel to <hi>John, v.</hi> 8. <hi>he is not, and yet he is; he was</hi> the Beaſt, or <hi>Rome;</hi> to wit, the Seat of ſeven Kings: <hi>he is not,</hi> the ſeat of Antichriſt, not as yet revealed: <hi>And yet he is;</hi> to wit, the ſeat of the Emperour, reigning in <hi>Iohns</hi> time. Theſe doe agree ſo fitly with <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſome Jeſuites are forced to confeſſe that <hi>Rome</hi> is that Beaſt. 7. As for Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, there is no thing more uſuall in Popery then to brag of miracles; but what are they? they are lying wonders: <hi>He maketh fire to come down from heaven;</hi> that is, by the thunder of excommunication, he brings the fire of Gods wrath from heaven; in token whereof, when he goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <pb n="190" facs="tcp:116006:102"/> to excommunicate Kings and Princes, he flings down from the Capitol burning torches: but if you look upon the literal interpretation, <hi>Hildebrand</hi> was wont to ſhake ſparkles of fire out of his ſleeves; And they record in the <hi>Legends,</hi> that at the requeſts of holy men, fire hath been brought down from heaven. But <hi>he gives life alſo to the image of the Beaſt.</hi> By the name of image, idolatry is underſtood, by introducing of which, the Gentile idolatry as it were raiſed again out of the grave, was reſtored and quickned: but in a literal ſenſe this is true; for it is known how Papiſts have cauſed their images laugh, weep, ſpeak, &amp;c. We read in the <hi>Legend</hi> of <hi>Thomas,</hi> that when he had preſented to Chriſts image the third part of his Theologie, He asked if he had written well or not? The image anſwered; <hi>Thomas, thou haſt written very well.</hi> 8. He puts a mark upon his followers, in which apiſhly, he imitates Chriſt, who ſigns his ſervants on the forehead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.5. &amp;c. Beſides, the mark, the name, and number of of the Beaſt are the ſame; to wit, the name containing the number 666. That name in <hi>Ireneus,</hi> the ſcholler of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> who was Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> diſciple, is λατεῖνος, the letters of which do exactly make up 666.

Again, nature may be called grace: for whatſover is not of due debt, is of grace; ſuch is nature, and all natural powers, and actions; for it is of grace that we live, and move and have our being in God; who is the prime and univerſal cauſe, without whoſe influence the ſecond and ſubordinate cauſes cannot worke: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, even for the actions and faculties of nature, as eating drinking, ſleep, life, health, &amp;c. we are bound to give thanks, and to beg their continuance and preſervation; to which duty we are not tyed, if theſe be of debt, and not of grace. But ſaving grace is diſtinguiſhed from nature, as the garment from the body; the one may be loſt without the other: and ſo when the Fathers ſpeak of <hi>Adams</hi> original juſtice, they ſay, he loſt his garment, and was ſtripp'd naked.</p>

                        <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">For they differ, 1. In definition: for it is one thing not to account us unrighteous, and another thing to eſteem us righteous. Which that we may the better underſtand, we muſt know how theſe terms are different: <hi>Not juſt</hi> and <hi>juſt; Unjuſt</hi> and <hi>juſt; Not juſt</hi> and <hi>unjuſt; Not unjuſt</hi> and <hi>juſt. Not juſt</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> are contradictories. <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> are partly privatives, partly contraries. <hi>Not juſt</hi> and <hi>unjuſt,</hi> alſo <hi>Not unjuſt</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> are <hi>diverſa.</hi> We muſt alſo know, that <hi>Unjuſt</hi> and <hi>Juſt</hi> are not immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries: for the <hi>medium</hi> is innocent, who is neither unjuſt, nor juſt. Now whereas the remiſſion of ſins, is a removing or putting away of our ſins; but the imputation of juſtice, is the adjudging of it to be ours: by that we are accounted for not unjuſt, or innocent; by this, for juſt. Now who knowes not, that it is more to be juſt, then to be innocent only; and not only to have done no evil, but alſo to have done good? But although theſe two now in man differ not in ſubject, but in ſome reſpect only; yet heretofore they differed in ſubject alſo: For <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice was innocent, but not juſt; for he was at length to attain juſtice by his perfect obedience. 2. They differ in their proximate and proper cauſes: for Chriſts death and paſſion are the cauſe or remiſſion of ſins, which are expiated by them, Heb. 9.22. <hi>Without blood there is no remiſſion.</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> But the cauſe of the imputation of juſtice, is Chriſts perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Rom. 5.19. <hi>For as by the diſobedience of one man many are made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one many are made righteous.</hi> We have ſhewed above, <hi>Cap.</hi> 18. that this <pb n="207" facs="tcp:116006:110"/> obedience is that actual, by which he fulfilleth the whole Law for us. 3. They differ in their proper effects, for by remiſſion of ſins we are freed from damnation, Rom. 5.9. <hi>Much more then now being juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him:</hi> But by imputation of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, we attain over and above life eternal. Rom. 5.17. <hi>Much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſſe, ſhall reign, &amp;c.</hi> ſo Gal. 4.5. both effects are put; <hi>Made under the Law, that he might redeem them that are under the law</hi> (that is under the curſe of the law) <hi>and that wee might receive adoption.</hi> It is then a greater benefit to redeem a Slave, and being redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to adopt him, then onely to redeem; it is a greater favour to give and forgive, then barely to forgive; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that juſtification is lame, by which onely Chriſts paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is imputed, and which onely conſiſteth in remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                        <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">Here divers things are objected, 1. The Scripture in many places makes mention of Chriſts Paſſion, or Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins onely. But this is no wonder, for in many places it ſpeaks Synecdochically; its ſufficient that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it ſelf in the above-cited places. 2. The Apoſtle promiſcuouſly uſeth theſe phraſes as equavalent; <hi>to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſins,</hi> and <hi>to impute righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 4.5, 6. But we anſwer, that it is one thing for propoſitions to be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, and an other thing for one propoſition to follow upon, or to conclude another: as <hi>Paul</hi> out of this phraſe of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 32.2. <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given them, &amp;c.</hi> collects this, that <hi>David doth deſcribe him to be bleſſed to whom righteouſneſſe is imputed without works.</hi> The reaſon of the conſequence is, becauſe if the remiſſion of ſins be free, then ſo is alſo the imputation of juſtice; Although then that is not formally ſpoken by <hi>David,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, v. 5. yet it is ſpoken by way of conſequence: yea, it is an argumentation, as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> ſaith, from the leſſer to the greater; for if he be bleſſed whoſe ſins are forgiven, then much more bleſſed <pb n="208" facs="tcp:116006:111"/> is he to whom beſides righteouſneſſe is imputed. 3. To whom ſins are forgiven, to him alſo righteouſneſſe is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; and whoſoever is freed from damnation, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritor of life eternal: therefore theſe benefits are not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thoſe things are not the ſame, which are in the ſame ſubject together: For ſo it would follow, that Vocation, Juſtification, and Sanctification are not different benefits, becauſe every man that is called is alſo juſtified and ſanctified. 4. In the pardon of ſins, there are the ſins of omiſſion pardoned; and therefore by that man is made perfectly juſt: They adde the reaſon of the conſequence; Becauſe he performs all things, who omits nothing. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The conſequence is falſe: becauſe there is one cauſe why we are ſaid to have omitted nothing; another, why we are ſaid to have done all things. We are ſaid to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nothing, becauſe Chriſt hath ſuffered for our ſins alſo of omiſſion: But we are ſaid to have performed all things, becauſe he hath for us performed all things. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, to have omitted nothing, and to have done all things, differ in reſpect of puniſhment and reward: for although the fault and the puniſhment are remitted to him who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits what he ſhould do, yet for this there is no reward due to him. 5. It is abſurd, that the ſame debt ſhould be paid twice: If therefore ſatisfaction is made for ſin by Chriſts ſuffering, ſatisfaction alſo is not to be demanded by active obedience. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here is <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi:</hi> for there is is not a double payment of the ſame debt, but two parts of one payment; Neither is Chriſts active obedience requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make ſatisfaction for ſin, but to ſatisfie for our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Kingdom of heaven. 6. If it be the ſame thing to be liberal, and not to be prodigal nor covetous; then it is the ſame thing to be juſt, and not unjuſt. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Aſſumption is falſe, becauſe theſe are not immediate op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites; for there are men who are neither covetous, nor prodigal, nor liberal. 7. If it be the ſame thing to be clothed, and to have nakedneſſe covered; then it is the ſame thing to have our ſinnes remitted, and juſtice imputed; becauſe <pb n="209" facs="tcp:116006:111"/> by the garment of Chriſts righteouſneſſe our ſins are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is an unfit ſimile: for the ſinner muſt not only be clothed, but he muſt be firſt unclothed, to wit from the rags of ſin. Therefore as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> the High-Prieſt had his filthy garments taken from him firſt, then new garments were put upon him, and a crown on his head, <hi>Zac.</hi> 3.4, 5.

They ſay, that all admonitions will be in vain, and ſo away will be made to carnal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This will not follow: for this Doctrine is ſo far from occaſioning ſecurity, that it rather drawes us from it. 1. Becauſe it is one thing to ſtand, and another thing to ſeem to ſtand, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man can promiſe to himſelf the certainty of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, except he try his Faith by his Sanctification. 3.

                                 <hi>* This opinion of the calling of the Jewes, is plauſible, if it were found in Scripture.]</hi> Here <hi>Wollebius</hi> ſtrives to weaken the opinion of the Jews converſion before the laſt <pb n="223" facs="tcp:116006:118"/> day; ſo did of old <hi>Caeſarienſis, Greg. Nazianzen</hi>'s brother, <hi>Dial. 4.</hi> by denying, that in Scripture their converſion is expreſſed: whereas indeed the Scripture in many places speaks of this generall calling. And though <hi>Hierome</hi> on <hi>Iſa. 11.</hi> and <hi>Hoſ. 9.</hi> ſeem to contradict this truth; yet we ſhall find, that he doth not abſolutely speak againſt their final converſion, but againſt the manner of it, which the Jews thought ſhould be effected by <hi>Ellas,</hi> whom they dreamed would reduce them again into their own Country, and re-eſtabliſh the ancient Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the whole Judaical worſhip. But to deny a total converſion of the Jews to Chriſt, is to keep up the partition-wall ſtill, which Chriſt came to break down, repreſented by the rupture of the veil of the Temple at Chriſts death. Why was Chriſt called the Corner-ſtone, if he did not mean to unite the two wals of Jew and Gentile? And how can that propheſie of his be fulfilled, <hi>There ſhall be one ſheepfold, as there is but one Shepheard?</hi> That propheſie of <hi>Zachary, c. 12. v. 10. Rev. 1.7. They ſhall look on him whom they have pierced, and ſhall mourn for him;</hi> muſt be underſtood of the Jewes final converſion, which ſhall be with godly ſorrow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, before the laſt day: for it is ſaid there, <hi>He ſhall come wirh clouds. Luk. 21.27.</hi> Our Saviour foretels, that <hi>Jeruſalem ſhall be trodden under, till the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be brought in.</hi> We read in <hi>Rev. 7.</hi> that beſides the <hi>innumerable multitude of all Nations that ſtood before the Lamb, there were of the Iſraelites alſo an hundred forty and four thouſand on Mount Sion;</hi> A definite number being uſed for an indefinite: by which is intimated the Jewes total converſion. In <hi>Malachi, c. 4. Elias</hi> is promiſed <hi>to turn the hearts of the fathers towards their children:</hi> which Propheſies the old Doctors apply to the converſion of the Jews by the preaching of <hi>Elias;</hi> and Chriſt tels us, that <hi>Elias ſhall come and reſtore all things,</hi> Mat. <hi>17.11.</hi> This propheſie indeed is applyed by Chriſt to his firſt coming, and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> there is called <hi>Elias;</hi> yet this hinders not the application of the ſame propheſie to his ſecond coming <pb n="224" facs="tcp:116006:119"/> alſo: before which, either <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall come, or elſe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preachers, <hi>in the force and ſpirit of</hi> Elias, who ſhall convert the Jews: And ſo the Fathers interpret theſe words, <hi>Pſal. 59.6.14. They ſhall return in the evening;</hi> of the converſion of the Jews in the end of the world: And ſo they obſerve, that their late entry into the Church of Chriſt, which is <hi>the houſe ot the living God,</hi> was prefigured by the elder brother, <hi>Luk. 15.</hi> who came not in till he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by his father; and that was after the younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Gentiles had returned. But their converſion is more plainly foretell by <hi>Hoſea, cap. 1.11. The children of Judah and Iſrael ſhall be gathered together, and appoint themſelves one Head:</hi> This cannot be meant ſo much of their return from their diſperſion in their firſt captivity, as of their laſt converſion; for the Iſraelites never returned from their firſt captivity. This is more fully explained in <hi>Hoſea, cap. 3.5. Afterward ſhall the children of Iſrael return, and ſeek the Lord their God, and</hi> David <hi>their King; and ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs in the latter dayes.</hi> Here by the latter dayes we cannot underſtand Chriſts firſt coming; for we do not finde, that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie hath been yet accompliſhed. Some few here and there have been converted; but what is that to a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the whole Nation, or at leaſt, of the greateſt part? which the Apoſtle expreſſeth fully, <hi>Rom. 11.25. I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this myſtery, that blindneſs in part is hapned to Iſrael, untill the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in, and ſo all Iſrael ſhall he ſaved:</hi> and ver. <hi>32.

Neither doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf, who having proved the converſion of the Jews, ſaith, <hi>1 Theſ. 2.16.

To conclude, the Apoſtle proves out of <hi>Iſa. 59.20. That all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved, becauſe there ſhall come to Sion, (or as the LXX. tranſlated it) out of Sion, the deliverer, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from</hi> Iacob, <hi>Rom. 11.26.</hi> This Propheſie hath not been yet accompliſhed, therefore it is to be fulfilled in the end of the world, when the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from the whole Nation of the Jews.<pb n="222" facs="tcp:116006:118"/>
                              </p>
                           </note> This opinion is plauſible, if it it were found in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. The Prophetical teſtimonies which they alleadge were fulfilled in the Apoſtles times, when upon the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the partition-wall, the Jews and Gentiles were united into one body. In the <hi>Revelation</hi> we find nothing
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:116006:120"/> that doth ſolidly confirm this opinion. Their chief hold is in that of Rom. 11.25, 26. <hi>For I would not brethren that you ſhould be ignorant of this myſterie, leſt ye ſhould be wiſe in your own conceit; that blindneſs in part is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to Iſrael, until the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in, and ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved.</hi> The Apoſtles ſcope in this is, to dehort Chriſtians from inſulting over the Jews that are rejected, becauſe they themſelves are called. The reaſon is, becauſe by their ruine the Gentiles have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſalvation, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. Yet ſo that all hope of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is not cut off from the Jews. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Nor are they exempted from being rejected, who being Chriſtians one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in name, are puffed up in their mindes, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21. That former paſſage of the rejection of the Jews, which was not altogether without hope of pardon, doth ſhew in a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that the Jews were not totally, but in part only rejected; not in reſpect of time, for it was to laſt onely a while, but in reſpect of that part of the Jewiſh Nation which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Reprobates: ſo that the meaning is this; blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath hapned not to all the Jews, but to a part onely, that is, to the reprobates. Neither have theſe words, <hi>untill the fulneſs of the Gentiles come in,</hi> this meaning, that there ſhall be ſuch a plauſible calling of the Jews, after the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Gentiles is come in: For there is nothing more uſual then that theſe particles <hi>untill</hi> or <hi>till,</hi> being denyed or affirmed, ſignifie the ſame that <hi>never</hi> or <hi>always:</hi> As we
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:116006:120"/> ſhewed above, <hi>c.</hi> 19. Neither doth that which the Apoſtle ſubjoyns, <hi>v.</hi> 26. hinder any thing this interpretaton, <hi>And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved:</hi> For by the name of <hi>all Iſrael,</hi> he underſtands the Elect, which indeed are the true Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, as above <hi>c.</hi> 9.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſheweth. And alſo in the following places, <hi>v.</hi> 28, <hi>c.</hi> 11. he explains, ſaying, <hi>As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Gospel, they are enemies for your ſakes; but as touching the Election, they are beloved for their fathers ſakes.</hi> The ſumme of the whole place is this: The reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Jewes nation in part, (whereby blindneſſe ſhall remain upon the reprobate) doth no wayes prejudice the elect of that ſame nation, but they alſo, and ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this viſible world was made for man to ſojourn in whilſt he was a traveller; but when his journey is ended, and he in heaven, there will be no more need of this world. 2. Becauſe this ſtands with the order of things: For ſeeing eternity belongs to God, who is without beginning and ending; but to Spirits, <hi>aevum,</hi> which is that duration that hath beginning, but wants ending; to Phyſical things time is aſcribed, conſiſting both of beginning and ending. To the former objections thus they anſwer: The place of Rom. 8.19, 20, 21, 22. is not meant of the reſtauration of this world, but of its freedom from vanity to which it is ſubject, which vanity conſiſts in this, that moſt men do moſt wickedly abuſe the ſervice of the creatures; hence by Proſopopeia or fiction of the perſon, they are ſaid to deſire liberty. The place in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. teacheth rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to wit, that this world ſhall not remain; although in that place mention is not made of the world it ſelf, ſo much as of worldly things, to wit, riches, pleaſures and ſuch like. They teach, that the new heaven in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. doth as it were point out the new world, which the Elect ſhall inhabite in their heavenly countrey. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more frequent then that allegory, whereby the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the bleſſed is likened ſometimes to the earth, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the viſible heaven: and to this purpoſe, is that which <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of righteouſneſs, which ſhall dwell there. For it's certain, that after this world, juſtice ſhall dwell no where but in heaven. To the firſt reaſon, they anſwer, that there is no conſequence from the Flood to the laſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the Flood brought not with it the end of the world: ſo likewiſe in the other reaſon, they deny the ſequel from man to the world; becauſe the world will be no ways <pb n="238" facs="tcp:116006:126"/> available to man, when he is advanced to life eternal, for it was made only for him whilſt he was a traveller here. Now although in controverſies of this nature, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw not the Articles of Faith, it be lawful to ſuſpend our aſſent; yet, without prejudice to other mens judgments, the underſtanding Reader may ſubſcribe to the latter opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for it is one thing to be reſtored, and changed unto a better eſtate; and another thing to wax old like a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to vaniſh like ſmoak, to be diſſolved, to melt, to be burned, to paſs away, to be no more, as the former te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies affirm.</p>

                  <p>SO much of the general Vertues or Works: the ſpecial, belong to the immediate, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>Gods immediate worſhip, is that which is performed to him immediately, and is taught in the firſt Table.</p>
                  <p>This is either internal onely, or elſe exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and internal both.</p>
                  <p>The internal worſhip onely, is that which reſides in the heart, and is enjoyned in the firſt Precept.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme whereof is, that we worſhip and know him alone for the true God.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">For the precept is negative, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me:</hi> from this is gathered an affirmative, <hi>Know and worſhip me alone for God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore to this precept belongs the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and a religious affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:116006:132"/>
                  <p>The knowledge of God is, whereby we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be the onely true God, as he reveals himſelf to us in Scripture.</p>

                  <p>Religious affection towards God, conſiſteth in Faith, Hope, Charity, Confidence in God, Fear, Repentance, Patience, and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">For to acknowledge any for God, is to believe, to place truſt and confidence in him, to love and fear him above all things, to ſubmit patiently to his will, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all good things for his gifts.</p>
                  <p>Faith is, whereby we lay hold on God, as our God and Father, and firmly believe his Word, Promiſes, and Threatnings.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">We conſidered Faith before, as the inſtrument of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Sanctification; but here, as a vertue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal work of God in reference to his worſhip.</p>
                  <p>To Faith is oppoſite <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or Infidelity, and doubting of the goodneſſe and power of God; as alſo the preſumption of Faith.</p>

                  <p>Confidence is a vertue, whereby we reſt in God and in his Promiſes, and totally depend on him in all things both corporal &amp; ſpiritual.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">We have already ſpoken of Confidence, as it is the form of Faith, and applieth to the heart the Promiſes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt: Here it is conſidered, as the effect of Faith; Of this, <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thy heart,</hi> Prov. 3.5.</p>
                  <p>Contrary to this, is diſtruſt in God, and truſt or confidence in Idols.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">An example of diſtruſt, is in the Iſraelites: Pſal. 78.19, 20. in David, 1 Sam. 27.1. in the Kings Captain, 2 King. 6.35. in <hi>Ahaz,</hi> Iſa. 7.12. in thoſe that are too carefull what they ſhall eat, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.25. Idolatrous confidence is that which man puts in the Devil, as Witches doe; or in Idols, as <hi>Ahazia,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.2. or in mens inventions, as Papiſts; or in the arm of fleſh, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. or in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Fortifications, Phyſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Aſa,</hi> who implored the help of the Syrians, and conſulted with Phyſitians, not with God; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.7. and 12. Yet it is lawful to make uſe of outward helps and aid, ſo we place not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in them; we muſt uſe them as ſervants, not truſt in them as gods.</p>
                  <p>Hope is that, whereby we expect undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods future favours, eſpecially the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of our relying on Gods promiſes, and Chriſts merits.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">Hope differs from faith, as the effect from the cauſe: for the object of faith, is the promiſe on which faith relies; the object of hope, is the thing promiſed, which hope expects.</p>
                  <p>Contrary to theſe, are doubtings, deſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and idolatrous hope.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">Sometimes the godly fall into doubtings, 1 Sam. 27.1. <hi>David ſaid in his heart, I ſhall now periſh one day by <pb n="252" facs="tcp:116006:133"/> the hand of</hi> Saul. But the wicked onely fall into a totall and final deſperation: ſo did <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4. <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 28. and 31. <hi>Achitophel,</hi> 2 Sam. 17. <hi>Judas,</hi> Matt. 27. and ſuch like: Idolatrous hope is in Papiſts, who call the Wooden Croſſe, <hi>Mary, &amp;c.</hi> their hope; and expect life eternal for their merits, ſatisfactions, indulgences.</p>
                  <p>Charity is that, whereby God is loved ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and above all things elſe, as the chief good.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">For ſo it is commanded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37.</p>
                  <p>Contrary to this, is the hatred of God, and idolatrous love; whereby the world and the things therein, are loved more then God.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">Joh. 15.18. <hi>They have hated both me and my Father.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15. <hi>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fear of God, whereby we ſo reverence Gods word and majeſty, that by all means we are loth to offend ſo bountifull a Father, not ſo much out of the fear of puniſhment, as the love of God.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">The fear of God is ſometimes taken for the whole wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; but here that vertue is underſtood, which is called filial fear.</p>
                  <p>To theſe are oppoſite, carnal ſecurity, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, and idolatrous fear</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">The ſecurity of the godly, differs farre from that of the wicked: for in the one, the fear of God is not loſt; in the other the fear of God is not found. Servile fear differs from filial: I. Filial fear proceeds from the love of God; but ſervile, from the feare or hatred of God. II. In filial, we feare to offend God, becauſe he is a Father; in ſervile, we fear to be puniſhed by him, becauſe he is a Judge. III. <pb n="253" facs="tcp:116006:133"/> Filial, draws a man to God; ſervile, drives a man from God. Idolatrous fear is, when one is more afraid of men and the world, then of God, Mat. 10.28. <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Repentance is, whereby we acknowledge our ſins, and bewail them being acknowledged; and withall cheare up our ſelves in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods mercy through Chriſts merits, and reſolve to obey God, and to refrain from ſinne.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">We have ſhewed in the former book, <hi>cap.</hi> 30. how Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, and Reſipiſcence differ: now this word <hi>reſipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence,</hi> is taken either for the whole change of man, or ſpecial vocation; or elſe for ſanctification, or for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſanctification, and part of Gods internal worſhip; in the third ſignification it is here conſidered.</p>
                  <p>There are three parts thereof; 1. Contrition, 2. Confidence, 3. Purpoſe of amendement.</p>
                  <p>To this is oppoſite perſeverance and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in ſin; as likewiſe feigned and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous repentance.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">An example of feigned repentance, is in <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 King. 21. Idolatrous repentance is that of the Papiſts which they place, 1. in contrition, 2. in confeſſion, 3. in ſatisfaction; and by which they think their ſins are expiated: but theſe three were in <hi>Judas</hi> his repentance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>Gratitude towards God, is whereby we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly acknowledge his goodneſſe and bleſſings beſtowed on us undeſervedly; withall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to glorifie him ſeriouſly.</p>

We had plenty of victuals, and were well, and ſaw no evil.</hi> Hab. 1.16. <hi>The wicked ſacrificeth to his own nets, and offereth incenſe to his own yearn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Patience is that, whereby we are ſuſtained in the faith of Gods providence, power, and bounty; and when he viſites us with afflictions, we ſubmit our ſelves with humility to his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">There be divers kindes of afflictions for the exerciſing of our patience; for beſides the vengeance that God doth poure out on the wicked; the affliction of Gods children is either <hi>chaſtiſement,</hi> or <hi>tryal,</hi> or laſtly martyrdome, bloody and unbloody.</p>
                  <p>To patience, are oppoſite impatience, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical patience, and ſtoical Apathies, or want of paſſion.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">To impatience belongs complaining or grumbling in afflictions, as if they were underſerved; and ſoftneſſe.

The blood of Martyrs hath evermore been the ſeed of the Church. <hi>10.</hi> The forcing of Religion hath been the cauſe of much miſchief, murthers, diſorder, and changes in States: therefore the wiſe <hi>Romans</hi> permitted the Jewes, after thy were ſubdued, to uſe freely their own Religion; neither did they force any of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Nations to accept the Roman religion. <hi>11.</hi> Where violence is uſed, there can be no juſtice. <hi>11.</hi> Nor God: for he is not to be found in earthquakes, whirlwinds, and fire, but in the ſoft and ſtill voice. <hi>13.</hi> The forcing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is the maintaining of hypocriſie; for all ſuch are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, who are forced to profeſſe outwardly what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly they hate. <hi>14.</hi> The forcing of Religion is the undoing of Religion; for, its moſt dangerous enemies are the ſecret enemies that lurk in the boſome of the Church; they'll kiſſe Religion with the mouth, and in the interim ſtab it with their hidden knife. <hi>15.</hi> Faith is the gift of God, being a theological vertue infuſed, not acquired: if it be not then in our own power to believe, till it be given us from above, how can it be in the power of any other to make us believe? how can they force us to take that which is not given? to profeſſe that which we have not received?</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of works belonging in ſpecial to the Second Commandment.</head>
                  <p>IN true Religion, we muſt conſider its parts, and time, appointed by God.</p>
                  <p>The parts are two: to wit, the Forme or rite whereby God will be worſhipped in his Church; and the Sanctification of his Name, all the reſt of our life.</p>
                  <p>The form of his worſhip, is that which he hath preſcribed to us in his Word, which is handled in the Second Precept; the ſumme whereof is this, That God ſhould be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch manner as he hath preſcribed.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">This appears by the right Analyſis of the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which is fooliſhly confounded with the firſt: For <pb n="259" facs="tcp:116006:136"/> as in the firſt Command is ſet down, who muſt be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for God; ſo in this ſecond is ſhewed, after what manner he will be worſhipped: And as in the firſt, internal ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry is contrary; ſo in the ſecond, external is oppoſed to this worſhip. The parts of this Command are two; a Prohibition, and a Confirmation. Of the Prohibition there are two branches: the firſt is, of the making; the ſecond, of the worſhiping of Idols. Of the making he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven image, or likeneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> which he illuſtrates by enumeration of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars following, to wit, <hi>of any thing in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth.</hi> The veneration of idols is declared two wayes: 1. By bowing to them, 2. By worſhiping of them. The Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation contains a threatening, and a promiſe; both are illuſtrated from the nature of God, and from the object: In the one he deſcribes himſelf to be <hi>a jealous God, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting iniquities, &amp;c.</hi> In the other, <hi>merciful.</hi> In the one, he denounceth puniſhment <hi>to the third and fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them that hate him;</hi> but in the other, <hi>his mercy to the thouſand generation of them that love him.</hi> It is eaſie then to ſee what is the ſumme of this precept, by the proceeding thereof, 1. From the particular to the general; for Idolatry is forbid, with all ſuch rites as are either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to, or not contained in the Word of God. 2. From the negation to the affirmation of the contrary: for it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that we worſhip God in that way which he hath preſcribed to us.</p>
                  <p>In the rites preſcribed to the Church, we muſt obſerve both the helps and parts thereof.</p>
                  <p>The parts are, the right uſe of the Word and Sacraments, and Prayer.</p>
                  <p>The right uſe or handling of the Word and Sacraments is, when the one is preached, the other adminiſtred according to Chriſts inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:116006:137"/>
                  <p>Prayer is, whereby we ſpeak to God in the true and humble contrition of heart, of ſuch things as are agreeable to his holy will. This conſiſteth in calling upon God, or in giving of thanks.</p>

                  <p>SO much of the manner of Gods Worſhip; the hallowing of his Name in all the reſt of our life, is injoyned in the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; The ſumme whereof is, that <pb n="275" facs="tcp:116006:144"/> we muſt ſtudy in all things to ſanctifie the name of God, even out of the times of his ordinary Worſhip.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">There be two parts of this command; a prohibition, and a confirmation of it. The prohibition is: <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vaine.</hi> The Name of God doth not only ſignifie the titles which are given to him, but his properties alſo, his word, workes, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe belongs to the glorifying of his Name; out of this prohibition is gathered a precept: <hi>Thou ſhalt ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the name of thy God:</hi> the confirmation is a heavy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; <hi>For the Lord will not hold him guiltleſſe that takes his Name in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sanctification of Gods Name, is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered either in affection, or in effect.</p>
                  <p>In affection is zeal for Gods glory; to wit, a vehement affection of the mind to maintain and inlarge the glory of Gods name, with juſt ſorrow and indignation againſt thoſe things that are contrary to his glory.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">Examples of this are in Lot, 2 Pet. 2.8. in Moſes, Exod. 32.19. in Phineas, Numb. 25.8. in David, Pſal. 69, &amp; 119.53. in Elijah, 1 King. 19.10. in Jeremiah, Jer. 33.9, 10, 11. in John Baptiſt, Mat. 14.14. in Chriſt, Joh. 2.14, &amp;c. in Paul, Act. 14.14, &amp; 17.16, 17.</p>

                  <p>The Sanctifying of Gods Name in effect or actually, is either by words, or by deeds; Sanctifying by words, is a holy uſing of Gods name, and a conſtant confeſſion thereof. The holy uſing of his Name is, whereby we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeak of him but in caſes of neceſſity, and that with great reverence and admiration; praiſing the glory ſhining in it.</p>

                  <p>Conſecration is, when things for our uſe are ſanctified by the Word of God and by Prayer.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To this conſecration is oppoſite, beſides the intermiſſion of it, ſuperſtitious conſecration, when in certain formes of words, there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be a ſingular force and efficacie; ſo likewiſe Magick inchantments and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                  <p>OF the mediate worſhip of God, of which we have now ſpoken in general, both the parts, and degrees are to be conſidered. The parts are two: The firſt is, of the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors duty towards his Inferiors, and contrarily: The latter is, of every mans duty towards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <p>The duty of Inferiors to their Superiors, and contrarily, is ſet down in the Fifth Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; the ſumme whereof is, That between ſuperios and inferiors that order may be kept, which is pleaſing to God.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">This Command conſiſteth of a Precept, and a Promiſe. The precept is, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother.</hi> By the name of Parents, ſynecdochically are meant all Superiors, as the word <hi>Honour</hi> contains all things that are like honour. The Promiſe is, <hi>That thou mayeſt live long in the land which the Lord thy God hath given thee.</hi> In this promiſe is underſtood both the condition of Gods will, and of our ſalvation: for oftentimes God recompenceth the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this life, with the happineſſe of the other.</p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:116006:155"/>
                  <p>The perſons conſiderable in this precept, are Magiſtrates and Subjects, in the civil ſtate; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Pariſhioners, in the Eccleſiaſtick; Parents and Children, Husband and Wife, Maſters and Servants, in the Oeconomick; among which by way of Analogy may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned, Maſters and Schollers, Tutors and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils, old men and young, and ſuch as have more or leſſe of other gifts.</p>
                  <p>The duties of Inferiours to their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, are reverence, obedience, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
                  <p>Reverence is whereby we beſtow upon our Superiours due honour; thinking well of them, ſpeaking reverently to them, bearing with their infirmities, and giving them the firſt place, and leave to ſpeake or do firſt.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">This reverence is to be given to Magiſtrates, Rom. 13.7. <hi>Feare to whom feare, honour to whom honour, &amp;c.</hi> To Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Mat. 10.40. <hi>He that receiveth you receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me.</hi> To Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Lev. 19.3. <hi>Let every one of you feare his father and mother:</hi> See Prov. 23.22.

                  <p>To Reverence is oppoſite Irreverence, and contempt of Superiours.</p>

                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">They who neglect the means of preſerving life, they ſin by omiſſion; but they that put violent hands on themſelves, ſin by commiſſion. Now there be certain degrees of ſelf-murther; for either it is done directly by Sword, Halter, or Poyſon, or any ſuch way, or elſe indirectly: ſo they kill themſelves, who raſhly and wantonly expoſe themſelves to danger, as Wreſtlers, Rope-dancers, Drunkards, Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the unlawful preſerving of life is, which is done by lying, or ſuch like means.</p>
                  <p>The ſtudy of preſerving our neighbours life, is, when not onely we abſtain from hurting it, but we love his life, and preſervation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it according to our power.</p>
                  <p>To this is oppoſite the neglect of it, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ſlaughters, hatred, curſing, and railing, or upbraiding of any offence commited, or inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring infirmities.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">An example of neglect is in them who when they may defend thoſe that unjuſtly ſuffer death, doe not: Prov. 24.11. <hi>If thou forbear to deliver them who are drawn unto death, and thoſe that are ready to be ſlain; if thou ſayeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold we know it, &amp;c.</hi> How grievous unjuſt ſlaughter is, which is done not of private deſire, and not by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or publike authority; and how grievous a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this deſerveth, may be ſeen, Gen. 9.6. <hi>Who ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth mans blood, by man his blood ſhall be ſhed; becauſe God made man after his image.</hi> Of hatred, thus ſaith <hi>John</hi> 1 Epiſt. 3.15. <hi>VVhoſoever hateth his brother, is a man-ſlayer.</hi> Of evil ſpeaking or curſing, Chriſt ſaith, Mat. 5.22. <hi>VVhoſoever ſhall ſay to his brother,</hi> Racha, <hi>ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <pb n="304" facs="tcp:116006:159"/> of the Councel: but whoſoever ſhall ſay, thou fool, he ſhall be in danger of Hell fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this ſtudy are ſubordinate two kindes of vertues; ſome whereof conduce to with-hold our ſelves, and ſome to with-hold others, and deterre them from murther.</p>
                  <p>Of the firſt kind are, Innocency, Mildeneſſe, Clemency, Moderation.</p>
                  <p>Innocency is, when we avoid all means of hurting our neighbour.</p>
                  <p>To this is oppoſite, Injury in word and deed, and counterfeit innocency.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">That words are injurious and hurtful to mans life, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; for he is not eſteemed to live, but he that lives well: Hence Chriſt accounts evil words murther, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. of counterfeit innocency we have in <hi>Pilate</hi> an example, in waſhing his hands, <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>Mildeneſſe is a vertue whereby we curbe and bridle our anger, that it may not wax inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately hot.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">Matt. 5.5. <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To meekneſſe is oppoſite, Anger, unjuſt wrath, too much gentleneſſe or want of juſt anger, and deſire of revenge.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">Of anger <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, Eccleſ. 7.9. <hi>Be not haſty in thy spirit to be angry:</hi> Of unjuſt anger <hi>Moſes,</hi> Levit. 19. v. 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt not avenge, nor bear a grudge againſt the children of thy people:</hi> Of <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt's too much gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe, we read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. The deſire of revenge is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the place of <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. above alledged.</p>
                  <p>Clemency is a juſt moderation in inflicting of puniſhments.</p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:116006:159"/>
                  <p>To this is oppoſite Cruelty and fierceneſſe, and too much Indulgence.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">Both ſinnes are kinds of murther: for by too much ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and too much indulgence, we ſinne againſt the life of our neighbour: He hurts the good, that ſpares the evil.</p>
                  <p>Moderation is a vertue much like to Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, whereby we are content to part with our right, either for the publike good, or for the good of them who offend, or for avoiding of ſcandal.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">This differs from Clemencie; becauſe this is properly aſcribed to the Magiſtrate, but moderation is required of all Chriſtians, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.5.</p>
                  <p>To this is oppoſite, too much Right; which is commonly called, too much Wrong.</p>
                  <p>Of the latter ſort are, Vindicative Juſtice, and Fortitude.</p>
                  <p>The former is, when offences are curbed with fit puniſhments, that one rather may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh then unity.</p>
                  <p>To this is oppoſite too much Lenity, which begets too much liberty in ſinning.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">Not only is it a ſin to kill, but alſo not to kill, when the Law requires it: Of this we have an example in <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>Fortitude is that, whereby according to the ſtrength and vigor of a high and unconquered mind, we endure difficulties, and undertake high matters, to Gods glory, and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſafety.</p>
                  <p>To this, Sluggiſhneſſe is oppoſite, or Puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity, <pb n="306" facs="tcp:116006:160"/> ariſing out of fear of dancers, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of pleaſures; Temerity alſo, and too much boldneſſe. To this alſo belong Duels under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for deciding of doubtful rights, or upon other light and raſh occaſions.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">Such Conflicts may be fitly reduced to Self-murther.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe, to wit Juſtice and Fortitude, appear either in Peace, or in War.</p>
                  <p>War is publike hoſtility, which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate exerciſeth with armed power, for ends pleaſing to God, and profitable to the State.</p>

                  <p>THus of our duty towards the life of our neighbour. In the Seventh Precept is ſet down, how we muſt preſerve our own and neighbours Chaſtity; the ſumme whereof is, that the Heavenly Law-giver would have our own and neighbours chaſtity preſerved invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">This Precept is negative, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;</hi> and Synecdochical alſo: for under the name of Adultery, all luſt and intemperance is underſtood. Hence ariſeth the Affirmative; that by endeavouring temperance, we preſerve our own and others chaſtity.</p>
                  <p>There be two meanes to preſerve chaſtity; Temperance, and Wedlock: the firſt is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to all men; the other, to thoſe who are called to wedlock.</p>
                  <p>Temperance is a vertue moderating the affections of our mind, in perſuing and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bodily pleaſures.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To Temperance is oppoſed Intemperance and Inſenſibility, whereby honeſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full delights are deſpiſed; alſo Hypocritical temperance of Monks and Eremites.</p>
                  <p>Temperance is, both Sobriety and Chaſtity, as alſo Modeſty and Honeſty. The former vertues have relation to us, the latter to our neighbour.</p>
                  <p>Sobriety is temperance from ſuperfluous meat and drink.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To Sobriety is oppoſite, Delicateneſſe, whereby dainties and delicacies are fought for imoderately in meats &amp; drinks: Gluttony alſo, of Voracity, Drunkenes, &amp; hurtful Abſtinence.</p>

                  <p>Neer to Sobrietie is Vigilancie, when we abſtain from untimely and too much ſleep, that we may ſerve God with chearfulneſſe, and follow the works of our vocations.</p>

                  <p>Chaſtity, or Sanctimony ſo called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. is temperance from luſt.</p>

But in every caſe of Adultery, Divorce is not requiſite or lawfull: For, <hi>1.</hi> If the party offending repent, the party offended ought to forgive and be reconciled. <hi>2.</hi> If there be danger leſt the offending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fall into ſome deſperate courſe upon divorcement. <hi>3.</hi> If the Husband proſtitute his Wife to another, he being the cauſe rather of the Adultery then ſhee. <hi>4.</hi> If the woman is raviſhed by another man againſt her will. <hi>5.</hi> If the man, after the woman hath committed Adultery, and he knows it, admits her again unto his bed; in this caſe, he is not to divorce her for the former fact. <hi>6.</hi> If both the husband and wife be guilty of adultery, the one is not to divorce the other. <hi>7.</hi> If the husbands long abſence and ſilence hath occaſioned the wife to conceive he is dead, and ſhe many another; in this caſe, if he return, he is bound to receive his wife again. In all theſe caſes then, Divorce is not to be uſed; for Chriſt commands it not, but permits it. Again, if a man intending to marry one ſiſter, unwitingly marries the other, being deceived as <hi>Jacob</hi> was by <hi>Laban</hi> in marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Leah</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Rachel,</hi> he is not bound to divorce her.</p>

                  <p>HAving ſpoken of our duty towards our own and neighbours eſtate; now followes that we ſpeak of our duty towards our own and neighbours fame, in the ninth precept. The ſumme whereof is, that we preſerve our own and neighbours fame and good name.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">This precept is negative and Synecdochical; for under the phraſe of <hi>falſe witneſſe,</hi> is underſtood every thing whereby our own and neighbours fame or eſtimation is hurt; hence is collected an affirmative precept, <hi>That we ſtudy to preſerve our own and our neighbours fame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vertues of this precept are alſo twofold; <pb n="327" facs="tcp:116006:170"/> ſome have relation to our neighbour, ſome to our ſelves; thoſe which have reſpect to our neighbour, are truth and ſincerity; Truth is a vertue whereby we are bent to know thoſe things that be true, and to utt r or ſignifie the things known as they are.</p>
                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">Zach. 8.16. Epheſ. 4.25. <hi>Let every man ſpeak truth to his neighbour.</hi>

By this definition it appears, 1. That Schemes, Metaphors, Allegories, and ſuch like are not lies, ſeeing the truth of them depends not from fictions, but from the ſimilitude they have with true things; the ſame reaſon is of Ironies, which are uſed not to deceive, but to inſtruct; ſuch were uſed by <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 King. 18. and by <hi>Micaiah,</hi> 1 King. 22. 2. That it is one thing to ſpeak an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, another to lye; for one may ſpeak an untruth, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating other mens ſayings, or by ſpeaking that which he thinks to be true; but he lyeth, who utters a falſhood ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word or geſture, or any other way purpoſely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. 3. That diſſembling, deceits, and ſtratagems in war are not lies, ſo there be not perfidiouſneſſe and perjury joyned. The diſtinction of lyes into officious, jocond, and pernicious, ſhewes only this, that one lye is more grievous then another; however no lye is excuſable, but by all means muſt be avoided, both becauſe it is moſt ſeverely <pb n="328" facs="tcp:116006:171"/> forbid by God who is truth it ſelfe, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.16. as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a diabolical ſin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. to whom the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be added that is prepared for liars, Pſal. 5.6. <hi>Thou wilt deſtroy them that speake lies.</hi>

                  <p>The vertues belonging to this Precept, are, the ordering of concupiſcence, and our wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt evil deſires.</p>
                  <p>The ordering of concupiſcence is, whereby our appetites and affections are ſo ruled, that by them we neither offend againſt our ſelves, nor againſt our neighbour.</p>

                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">This word <hi>concupiſcence,</hi> among Divines is taken in a large ſenſe, both for the appetites and affections; of which the former are aſcribed to man, as he is a ſenſitive creature; but the latter, as he is man.

                  <p>Ordered appetites, are, whereby man deſires meat, drink, reſt, ſleep, and ſuch like, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and to the end appointed by God.</p>

                  <p rend="small" ana="#role_comment">To underſtand theſe degrees, that of <hi>James</hi> helps, c. 1. 14, &amp;c. <hi>Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and enticed; then when luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſinne; and ſinne when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death.</hi> We muſt then firſt reſiſt ſuggeſtions and thoughts, which are either aſcending from the fewel of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, or deſcending, being ſuggeſted elſewhere: the firſt are not without ſinne, the latter are not ſinnes, being caſt in by Satan, if ſo be we let them paſſe, and entertain them not. We cannot avoid the firſt degree; let us ſhun the ſecond, leſt we come to cheriſh evil thoughts with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: but we muſt chiefly beware of the third degree, that we give not our aſſent; for the more we obey the ſinne of concupiſcence, the more it increaſeth. Which that we may more and more avoid, we beſeech God the Father, in his Sonne, through the Holy Ghoſt: to which one God in Trinity, be praiſe, honour, and glory, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
